//Hi Suraj here, let me introduce you to Java.

//Simple and short keep in mind anything starting with capital letter Cosidered as Class in java. so here Main.

// Public means this particular method is available to the entire package and also with the other classes.
public class Main
{
  //this line is a function or method in java which is public and static means you can use method without creating object in java, Chill rest we study later.
	public static void main(String[] args) 
  {
    
    //this perticular line used to print statement in java, 
    
    //System Refers to class in Java, which provides methods and properties related to the system itself, such as input/output.
    
    //Refers to the println() method, which is a shorthand for "print line" 
    
    //"" <- this is used for string which can be any sentence or single letter or word in java.
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
